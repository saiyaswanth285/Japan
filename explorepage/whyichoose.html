          --> From my high school days, I've held a keen interest in Japan.
          Learning about the MEXT scholarship program opened my eyes to study
          opportunities there. Despite missing the deadline, my fascination with
          Japan only grew stronger. During my third year of engineering, I chose
          Japanese as an elective, delving into the language and culture,
          including values like punctuality and discipline. In my fourth year, a
          seminar by Sankar San shed light on job prospects in Japan, sparking
          my interest further.

          -->In India there is a payment method called as the Unified Payments
          Interface (UPI) has transformed digital payments. Using UPI and QR
          codes, transferring funds between bank accounts is seamless. Scanning
          a merchant's QR code with a UPI-enabled mobile app retrieves payment
          details, enabling quick and secure transactions with a UPI PIN. My
          curiosity piqued as I delved into QR code technology, learning that it
          was invented by Masahiro Hara and his team at Denso Wave in 1994 to
          track the automobile parts of their company, further igniting my
          interest in Japanese companies and technologies. The

          -->My journey into Japanese language and culture deepened as I joined
          a program offering full-fledged Japanese language education and
          employment opportunities in Japan. Learning Japanese became more than
          just acquiring a new skill. it became a gateway to experiencing
          Japan's rich culture and advancing my career in prestigious Japanese
          companies. The excitement of working in companies like Denso Wave,
          along with the chance to witness Japan's technological progress,
          inspired my ambition.

          -->Even though the QR code may seem small, it's had a big impact on a
          country like India. I'm inspired by this technology and want to work
          in a Japanese company. I hope to contribute to projects that make a
          difference in people's lives and show how technology can improve our
          daily routines.

        <p>
          -->The amazing ideas behind the QR code and the inventive drive of
          companies like Denso Wave made me want to work in Japan even more. As
          I learned Japanese and looked into jobs there, I felt drawn to the
          chance to add to Japan's tech scene and see its lively culture up
          close. Working in Japan isn't just something I want for my careerâ€”it's
          a dream that's full of excitement and wonders for me.
